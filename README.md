## üìù Projects Overview

### 1. **Number Guessing Game**
A fun game where the user needs to guess a number that the computer randomly selects. The game provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low.

- **Skills Learned**: Random number generation, user input, loops.

---

### 2. **Simple Calculator**
A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using Python.

- **Skills Learned**: Basic arithmetic, user input handling, function definitions.

---

### 3. **File Encryption & Decryption**
This project allows the user to encrypt and decrypt files using basic Python libraries. The encryption algorithm is symmetric.

- **Skills Learned**: File handling, cryptography basics, user authentication.

---

### 4. **Weather app**
Done a weather app using HTML,CSS,Java Script.

- **Skills Learned**: HTML,CSS,Java Script,API Keys.

---

### 5. **Stopwatch Clock**
A simple stopwatch and clock application built using Python's `tkinter` for the GUI.

- **Skills Learned**: Flask, time handling, event-driven programming.

### 6. **To-Do List**
A task management system that allows the user to add, remove, and track tasks.

- **Skills Learned**: Basic GUI, list operations, persistence (optional).

---

### 7. **IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis using LSTM**
A deep learning project where IMDb movie reviews are analyzed for sentiment using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

- **Skills Learned**: Natural Language Processing, sentiment analysis, machine learning using LSTM.
